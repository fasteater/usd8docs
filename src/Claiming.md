# Claiming

1. To initiate a claim, the user provides the hacked LP token and temporarily locks a certain amount of USD8. The more USD8 locked, the greater the weight of the claim. If the hacked LP is a USD8 position, locking USD8 is then optional.
2. The claim then enters a 10-day waiting period, during which other users may also join. After this time, further claims using this hacked LP token will not be accepted.
3. Users can finalize their reimbursement after the 10 days waiting period, reimbursement amount depends on the total claims and total locked Usd8 and will be paid in the exact asset types and composition of the Cover Pool.
4. 60 days after claiming, the locked USD8 will be released and can be withdrawn from the Cover Pool.

If the Cover Pool cannot fully cover all claims, assets are distributed proportionallyâ€”weighted by the amount of USD8 each user locked and the value of their LP tokens. <br/><br/>

# Claim Cooldown

Newly received USD8 are subject to a 30-day cooldown for claiming lock, except from recognized Defi contract addresses. This prevents users from immediately claiming with newly purchased USD8 while still allow holders to yield with Usd8 while enjoying the protection.
