# Cover Pool

The Cover Pool consists of multiple assets and is designed to generate competitive yields on each. Anyone can deposit into the pool at any time; however, withdrawals are subject to a 14-day cooldown period.

Assets in the Cover Pool serve a dual purpose: they earn yield and are also deployed to cover hacks in DeFi protocols protected by USD8.

# Covered DeFi Protocols
USD8, together with our security partners, independently vets and selects DeFi protocols that demonstrate the strongest security practices. Coverage is offered on a per-LP-token basis, depending on our security assessment, and is limited to a percentage of potential losses, capped by the Cover Pool size.

Once coverage is offered, the Cover Pool will accept the specified LP token for claims at any time, permissionlessly. Claimants receive a proportional mix of assets matching the Cover Poolâ€™s composition. <br/><br/><br/><br/>
