# ðŸ“Š Aggregated Exposure

This super power aims to diversify USD8â€™s backing from 100 % USDC to a basket of tier-one stable coins, lowering the protocolâ€™s exposure to any single asset and making USD8 more resilient to potential de-pegs.    

- Mint & redeem mechanics â€” When live, new USD8 will be minted and redeemed in the same fixed basket proportions, not solely in USDC.    
- Risk reduction â€” A blended reserve cushions the impact of volatility or peg pressure on any individual stablecoin.    

Full implementation details coming soon.
