# ü•∑ Cover Token

The Cover Token is a non-transferable token that allows holders to claim reimbursement‚Äîup to a limit‚Äîif any of their positions are hacked in a vetted DeFi protocol (not limited to USD8 positions). The more Cover Tokens a user holds, the greater their potential reimbursement. Reimbursements are paid from a Cover Pool financed by USD8.

The only way to obtain Cover Tokens is by using USD8‚Äîwhether holding, staking, or yielding. Cover Tokens are automatically accrued to USD8 users every block.

- Accrual rates are set by USD8 and may differ for holding, staking, or yielding.
- Users can claim reimbursement from the Cover Pool by burning Cover Tokens.
- The only way to obtain Cover Tokens is through using USD8.
- Cover Tokens never expire.

# üëåüèΩ Coverage Limits

Cover Tokens provide coverage for up to a maximum of 90% of a user's loss. The actual percentage is calculated per claim and depends on the following factors:

- The user's loss and Cover Token balance
- The aggregated loss and Cover Token balance from all claimants for the hack
- The per-protocol coverage tier
- The current Cover Pool size

This means a small Cover Token balance might still receive high coverage if there are few claimants, but a large balance might not guarantee high coverage if many others are also claiming with large balances.

In general, the larger a user's Cover Token balance, the greater the payout. This process is on-chain, with all information publicly available.

# üëõ Cover Pool

The Cover Pool is financed exclusively by USD8‚Äôs own earnings; user deposits remain untouched in a segregated Reserve Pool. The Cover Pool may start small, but as USD8‚Äôs user base and fee revenue grow, so does the size of the Cover Pool. This means the pool might not be able to cover 100% of hack losses, especially in the early days of USD8. However, we believe partial coverage is better than none, and we aim to grow the pool significantly as USD8 expands.

If a major payout drains the pool, USD8 will divert a portion of future profits to refill it on a monthly schedule until the target balance is restored.

# ü§û Covered DeFi Protocols

Cover Token extends permissionless hack coverage to selected DeFi protocols up to a limit. Our in-house security team performs independent audits and continuous reviews to ensure each listed protocol meets rigorous safety standards.

Each protocol is assigned a tier that caps the share of the Cover Pool available for any single incident:

- Platinum ‚Äì up to 100% of the Cover Pool
- Gold ‚Äì up to 80% of the Cover Pool
- Silver ‚Äì up to 40% of the Cover Pool
- Bronze ‚Äì up to 10% of the Cover Pool

Current covered protocols:

| Num | Protocol | Type | Condition |
|:---|:---|:---|:---|
| 1 | USD8 | Platinum | `1 USD8 redeems < $0.7`  |
| 2 | Uniswap V2 | Gold | `amt0 * amt1 < 70% * k where amt0 and amt1 are the amount of tokens redeemable from 1 LP token,  k is the tracked historical value of amt0 * amt1` |
| 4 | Aave V3 | Gold | `ValueOfSingleLP < 0.7 underlying` |
| 5 | Lido | Gold | `1 stEth redeems < 0.7 Eth` or `1 wstEth redeems < 0.7 Eth` |
| 6 | Rocket Pool | Gold | `1 rEth redeems < 0.7 Eth` |
| 7 | Uniswap V3 |  | Under Review |
| 8 | Uniswap V4 |  | Under Review |
| 9 | Sky |  | Under Review |
| 10 | Curve|  | Under Review |
| 11 | Compound |  | Under Review |
| 12 | Morpho |  | Under Review |
| 13 | Pendle|  | Under Review |
| 14 | Balancer |  | Under Review |
| 15 | More.. |  |  |

The USD8 team verifies, assigns, and‚Äîwhen necessary‚Äîupdates these covers on an ongoing basis. Coverage announcements, upgrades, downgrades, or removals are published transparently, and we encourage users to use only protocols that carry an active USD8 cover tier.

# üíµ Claims

Claims can be initiated permissionlessly at any time against the Cover Pool if claim conditions are met.

Once initiated, other users will have a two-week window to join the claim. After that, claims can be finalized.


- The protocol computes each claimant‚Äôs payout based on the total claim amount and Cover Token balance based on the following
- Claimants transfer the compromised LP/position tokens and burn the required Cover Tokens.
- Reimbursement is paid in USD8, calculated at the current oracle price.
- The LP token is removed from after a claim


The system uses the following formula to calculate actual reimburse amount for each user: <br/><br/>

$$actualAmt = max(\frac{coverPoolSize * protocolCoverLimit * userLpAmt}{\displaystyle\sum_{i=1}^n(1 + \frac{userCoverToken_i * f}{userLp_i}) * userLp_i}, 0.9 * lpValueBeforeHack)$$

- `protocolCoverLimit` is the factor associated with the cover type for this protocol
- `n` is the total number of claims
- `f` is a constant set by protocol to determines the weight of Cover Token in proportion to LP token in a claim
- `lpValueBeforeHack` is the LP value before the hack
