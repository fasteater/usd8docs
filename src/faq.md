# FAQs
## <span class="emoji">ðŸ’­</span> Can I just buy Usd8/sUsd8 and get coverage after my position is hacked?

No. Usd8/sUsd8 comes with a 30-day cooldown after you receive them. During this period, they cannot be used for claims.

## <span class="emoji">ðŸ’­</span> How safe is the Protected Savings vault?

It is one of the safest savings vaults because it includes 80% coverage. This means you can always claim up to 80% of your position from the Cover Pool if something goes wrong.

On top of that, you still earn competitive the yield.

<br/>

## <span class="emoji">ðŸ’­</span> How safe is the Cover Pool?
Assets deposited in the Cover Pool are used to cover hacking losses from Covered Protocols. This makes it riskier than the Protected Savings vault, which is why it offers a higher APY.
<br/>
Our security experts independently vet and audit every protocol before offering coverage. Hacks are not expected to occur often, but there is always a possibility.


## <span class="emoji">ðŸ’­</span> So all my positions in Covered DeFi Protocols are protected? Even non-Usd8 positions?

Yes. As long as you hold Usd8/sUsd8, you can lock them to claim for any non-Usd8 positions.

If itâ€™s a Usd8-based position (like sUsd8), you can claim directly with your LP token â€” no need to lock additional Usd8 or sUsd8.
<br/>
<br/>

## <span class="emoji">ðŸ’­</span> Do I forfeit my hacked LP token when claiming from the Cover Pool?

Yes. To claim from the Cover Pool, you must provide:
- The hacked LP token
- Lock some Usd8 or sUsd8 for 30 days (optional if the LP token is already a Usd8 position)

The hacked LP tokens are transferred to Cover Pool liquidity providers.

<br/>

## <span class="emoji">ðŸ’­</span> Will I always get 80% of my money back if my position is hacked in a protocol with 80% coverage?

Not necessarily. The actual reimbursed amount depends on:
- How many other users are claiming for the same hack and their position sizes
- How much Usd8/sUsd8 each claimant locks

In practice, the more Usd8/sUsd8 you lock, the higher your claim weight.
 
<br/>
<br/>

## <span class="emoji">ðŸ’­</span> How do you prevent fraudulent claims?

Usd8 only covers up to 80% of any position. Unless the LP tokenâ€™s value drops below 80%, it is not financially rational to file a false claim to the Cover Pool.

## <span class="emoji">ðŸ’­</span> How does Usd8 make money?

Like most stablecoins, Usd8 generates revenue from collateral yield.
- A portion of this yield is distributed to Usd8 Savings depositors.
- The remaining yield becomes Usd8â€™s revenue, which is primarily distributed to Cover Pool depositors.
