This superpower refunds the gas fees you spend when transferring USD8 on supported chains. Users can periodically claim a rebate based their USD8 transfer activity, all within a generous fair-use cap that covers the vast majority of users. By removing day-to-day gas costs, USD8 becomes the ideal token for payments and routine transactions.

Full implementation details coming soon.
