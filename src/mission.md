# Our Mission
As we embrace decentralized technology to resist the abuses of traditional centralized power, we also give up the enforcement mechanisms that deal with wrongdoing. Without safeguards, this opens the door to a technocratic reality where hackers—armed with superior technical knowledge—become the new “centralized power,” stealing in broad daylight with little consequence. That undermines the very purpose of decentralization, and it’s a future we, as true believers in this movement, refuse to accept.

That’s why we created USD8.

Our mission is to restore the missing layer of enforcement in DeFi security. We will start with offering hack coverage to DeFi users, with ambitious plans for the future to ensure the decentralized dream is not hijacked by technocrats, but preserved as a system that empowers everyone.
