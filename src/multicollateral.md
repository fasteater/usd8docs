# <span class="emoji">ðŸ“Š</span> Multi-Collateral

This super power aims to diversify USD8â€™s backing from 100% USDC to a basket of tier-one stable coins, lowering the protocolâ€™s exposure to any single asset and making USD8 more resilient to potential de-pegs while still provide yield opportunity for the multi-collaterals underlying.

- Mint & redeem mechanics â€” When live, new USD8 will be minted and redeemed in the same proportions of collaterals in the basket.   
- Risk reduction â€” A blended reserve cushions the impact of volatility or peg pressure on any individual stablecoin.    
- Each collateral's weight in the basket might be adjusted to maximize yield.

We are currently in the process of finalizing the collateral basket, details will be announced afterwards.
