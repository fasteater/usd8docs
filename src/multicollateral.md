# Multi-Collateral
<br/><br/><img src="http://usd8.finance/assets/power-collateral.png" width="200px" /><br/><br/>
This superpower aims to diversify USD8’s backing from 100% USDC to a basket of tier-one stable coins, lowering the protocol’s exposure to any single asset and making USD8 more resilient to potential de-pegs while still provide yield opportunity for the multi-collaterals underlying.

- Mint & redeem mechanics — When live, new USD8 will be minted and redeemed in the same proportions of collaterals in the basket.   
- Risk reduction — A blended reserve cushions the impact of volatility or peg pressure on any individual stablecoin.    
- Each collateral's weight in the basket might be adjusted to maximize yield.

We are currently in the process of finalizing the collateral basket, details will be announced afterwards.
