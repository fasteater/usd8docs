# Multi-Collateral

USD8 is backed by a carefully selected basket of stablecoins, reducing the protocol’s exposure to any single asset and making USD8 more resilient to de-pegging events.

- When launched, new USD8 will be minted and redeemed in the same proportions as the collaterals in the basket.
- Each collateral’s weight in the basket may be adjusted based on its ongoing risk profile.

We are currently finalizing the collateral basket. Details will be announced soon.
