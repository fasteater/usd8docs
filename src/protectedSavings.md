USD8 Protected Savings is a yield vault designed for passive DeFi users who want simple, deposit-and-forget yield with built-in protection.

Managed by USD8, this vault is covered by the Cover Pool for up to 80% of its value, subject to the pool’s limit.

Depositors receive yield-bearing sUSD8, which can be used to claim coverage from the Cover Pool, permissionlessly, at any time, up to 80% of the sUsd8 value, capped by the Cover Pool balance.
