# Usd8

Usd8 is a stablecoin doubles as hack protection, Usd8 users get hack coverage as well as stable yield. 

There are three main use cases:

1. Swap your stablecoins for USD8 and deposit into [Protected Savings](protectedSavings.md) to earn yield and receive hack coverage. This is ideal for passive DeFi users who want their savings protected.
2. Hold USD8 or sUsd8(from Protected Savings) and freely use any [Covered DeFi Protocols](CoverPool.md#covered-defi-protocols), with all positions protected by the Cover Pool. This suits advanced DeFi users actively managing their own yield strategies.
3. Deposit assets into the high-yield [Cover Pool](CoverPool.md) and share protocol revenue. However, these assets may be deployed to cover hacking losses from [Covered DeFi Protocols](CoverPool.md#covered-defi-protocols). This is ideal for users seeking high yields and willing to accept higher risk.
