# Usd8

Usd8 is a stablecoin doubles as hack protection, Usd8 users get hack coverage as well as stable yield. 

There are three main use cases:

1. For passive DeFi users who want their savings protected - Swap your stablecoins for Usd8 and deposit into [Protected Savings](protectedSavings.md) to earn yield and receive hack coverage. 
2. For advanced DeFi users actively managing their own yield strategies - Hold Usd8 (or USD yield tokens) and freely use any [Covered DeFi Protocols](CoverPool.md#covered-defi-protocols), now all your positions are protected by the Cover Pool.
3. For users seeking high yields and with high risk appetite - Deposit assets into the high-yield [Cover Pool](CoverPool.md) and share protocol revenue. However, remember these assets may be deployed to cover hacking losses from [Covered DeFi Protocols](CoverPool.md#covered-defi-protocols).
