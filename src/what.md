# What is USD8

USD8 is a stablecoin wrapper with extra super powers. Anyone can wrap or unwrap USD8 to and from the underlying stablecoin. By using USD8, users gain additional benefits on top of the underlying asset, while still retaining its core properties such as yield and a stable peg.

At launch, USD8 will accept USDC as the underlying stablecoin. Other stablecoins may be added in the future.

# Super Powers

USD8’s super powers are modular and often passive features, each providing users with unique benefits. By stacking these features, USD8 becomes a powerful stable asset with unlimited potential.

Below is a list of USD8’s super powers currently in development. Some will be available at launch, while others will be added over time:

- Hack Coverage
- Multi-Collateral
- Free Transfers
- Privacy
- Lucky Day
- <span class="inactive">And many more…</span>

# Why should I use USD8?

USD8 offers far more benefits than traditional stablecoins, while still maintaining the core properties of your current stablecoins. You can hold USD8 as a cash reserve or use it for yield. As USD8 grows, we expect to add even more exciting super powers, making it the first extendable stable asset.
