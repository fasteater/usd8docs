# White Hat Economy <span class="coming-soon-pill">Building</span>

The White Hat economy is the enforcement layer of USD8. It plays a critical role in recovering lost assets and deterring future malicious activities in Defi.<br/>

After a successful claim, the forfeited LP tokens become the property of the USD8 protocol, providing the financial engine to power the White Hat economy. We plan to explore multiple mechanisms depending on the size of the hack:

## <span class="emoji">📈</span> Tokenized Distressed Debt Market
Deploy on-chain primitives such as AMMs and bonding curves to facilitate tokenized distressed debt markets, unlocking a brand new primitive for Defi. Using this as a mechanism to fund early-stage recovery.

## <span class="emoji">🎯</span> Permanent Bounties & Anonymous Tips
Bounties up to a million dollars without an expiry date, paid in USD8 from the recovered funds. A hacker who launders successfully today still has a price on their address ten years from now.

Allow anyone to submit tips anonymously — wallet clusters, exchange deposits, off-ramp paths — tied to a specific incident. Submissions are timestamped and attributable; all submissions that help recover the lost funds will share a portion of the final bounty.

## <span class="emoji">🕵️</span> White Hat Guild & Open Education
Direct sponsorship of white hat groups, independent investigators, forensic firms, and ex-law-enforcement specialists. Alongside this, free curriculum, workshops, and tooling that lower the barrier for new investigators to participate. The more people who can read a transaction graph, the less defensible black-hat behavior becomes.

## <span class="emoji">⚖️</span> Legal Action & Law Enforcement
Direct fund civil suits, asset freezes, and cross-border legal coordination. A standing point of contact with relevant agencies in major jurisdictions, packaged with the evidence formats they actually use.

# Why This Matters

Insurance alone is reactive. The [Cover Pool](./cover-pool.md) makes users whole after a hack, but it does not change the incentives that produced the hack in the first place. 

The White Hat Economy is the second half of USD8's thesis — turning the proceeds of every claim into pressure on the attacker, and turning every member of the public into a potential adversary for bad actors. Combined with the Cover Pool, this is what closes the loop: victims get covered, recoveries fund more coverage, and the cost of attacking DeFi rises every time the system is used.

This is also how USD8 addresses the deeper problem laid out in our [Philosophical Roots](./philosophy.md) — the missing alignment and enforcement layer that has let malicious activity flourish in crypto. By rewarding good actors and imposing permanent, compounding risk on bad ones, the White Hat Economy realigns the industry's incentives and, over time, deters the next hack from being committed in the first place.
